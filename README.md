-OneLayerConvolution is to check the putputs of layers
linearELVES is not really linear but it is a simple regression of the MSE

-firstConvolution is a multilater convolutional nn

-lineaELVES is a perceptron on integrated time signal elves

-deserializeELVES is to take text files and make lua tensors out of them, all that by keeping the truth location of the elves. 

-slpELVES is a perceptron on full traces
